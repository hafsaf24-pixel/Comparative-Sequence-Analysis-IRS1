Sequence retrieval:
DNA sequences were retrieved from the NCBI Nucleotide database.
Protein sequences were retrieved from UniProtKB.

Sequence alignment:
Multiple sequence alignment was performed separately for DNA and protein sequences using MUSCLE implemented in MEGA, with default parameters.
Alignments were exported in FASTA format for downstream analysis and sharing.

Phylogenetic analysis:
Exploratory phylogenetic trees were constructed using both UPGMA and Maximum Likelihood methods in MEGA to assess sequence relationships across species. Maximum Likelihood trees were selected for reporting.

Analysis focus:
Analysis focused on identifying sequence conservation patterns across species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

This analysis was conducted as part of foundational training in comparative genomics and sequence analysis.
