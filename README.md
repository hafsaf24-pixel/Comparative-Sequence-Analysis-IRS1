# Comparative-Sequence-Analysis-IRS1
This repository contains a comparative analysis of the DNA and protein sequences of the **Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1)** gene across 20 species.

Sequence data were retrieved from public biological databases and aligned to examine conservation patterns at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to visualize relationships among species.

## 🧪 Methods

### Sequence Retrieval
- **DNA sequences:** NCBI Nucleotide Database  
- **Protein sequences:** UniProtKB

### Sequence Alignment
- Multiple sequence alignment was performed separately for DNA and protein sequences using **MUSCLE** implemented in **MEGA** with default parameters.  
- Alignments were exported in **FASTA** format for analysis and sharing.

### Phylogenetic Analysis
- Exploratory phylogenetic trees were constructed using both **UPGMA** and **Maximum Likelihood (ML)** methods in MEGA to assess sequence relationships across species.  
- **Maximum Likelihood trees** are presented here as the primary results.

### Analysis Focus
- The project focuses on identifying sequence conservation patterns across 20 species at both the DNA and protein levels.
