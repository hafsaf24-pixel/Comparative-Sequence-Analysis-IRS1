# Comparative-Sequence-Analysis-IRS1
Comparative DNA and protein sequence alignment of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1) gene across multiple species.

This repository contains a comparative analysis of the DNA and protein sequences of IRS1 gene across 20 species.

Sequence data was retrieved from public biological databases and aligned to examine conservation patterns at the nucleotide and amino acid levels by constructing phylogenetic trees.
Exploratory phylogenetic analysis was performed, and Maximum Likelihood trees are provided in the phylogeny/ directory.

This project was conducted as part of foundational training in genomics and sequence analysis.
